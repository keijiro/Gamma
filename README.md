Gamma is a live coding project with KodeLife and Unity.

I initially implemented a live coding project called [Beta] in 2017.
Gamma is a straightforward update using the latest versions of KodeLife and Unity.
I also switched the platform from PC to Mac.
Previously, MacBook didn't have enough processing power to run projects like this.
Now, I can run it on a MacBook in a standalone fashion. Sweet.

I did a live coding session with this project at the GitHub Universe 2023 Recap party.
